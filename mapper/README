html -- contains the html files, images, and data files used by the scripts.
scripts -- contains all the scripts I use to create and update the map.

To get up and running:
1. Add the info from '/scripts/dot_bashrc' to your own '.bashrc' and modify to
   point to your own web directory.
2. Add the 'update' and 'dnd' bash scripts to your path.
3. Add all the files from the 'html' directory to your web directory
   (from step 1).
4. Create a text file with the map (mine are in /html/maps/).
5. Run the file through the 'dnd' script and a new index.html should appear
   in your web directory (from step 1).
